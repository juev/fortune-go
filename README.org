** Creating custom files

In order to create a custom file, you must first create a file containing the quotes.
Between each quote you must add a line containing only the % character. 
Save this file using whatever name you want, for example myquotes. 
Then, run ~strfile myquotes~ in a terminal, in order to enable random access of the quotes. 
You can now access the quotes by executing fortune myquotes in a terminal. 
For this command to work you must be on the same directory as the ~myquotes~ and ~myquotes.dat~ files. 
If you want your quotes to be accessible by just running the fortune command, you must move both files into the =/usr/share/fortune/= directory. 
If you want to make any changes to your file, repeat from the start.
